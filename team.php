                                                As the son of an award winning architect and the grandson of a local builder, 
                                                Paul has been around construction his entire life.  Prior to founding Interlock Paving in 1985, 
                                                Paul lead Balcon Inc.’s sales and marketing team for their interlock concrete paver product line. 
                                                As an early adopter in the interlocking paver industry, Paul grew Balcon’s sales to over one million square 
                                                feet of pavers per year.

                                                to keep up with installation schedules.  Recognizing a need in the market for contractors specializing in 
                                                the installation of interlock concrete pavers, Paul started Interlock Paving on April 13, 1985 with the goal 
                                                of being the premier unit paving contractor in the region.  Interlock Paving’s first project was the Rosedale 
                                                Federal Savings bank on Belair Road in Baltimore, MD and after over 30 years Interlock’s original installation 
                                                is still in use today at this location.

                                                12 million square feet of pavers installed.  Paul prides himself in knowing that Interlock has completed
